What is Cmake?

CMake is an extensible, open-source system that manages the build process in an operating system and in a compiler-independent manner.

Why do we need Cmake?

1. CMake is designed to be used in conjunction with the native build environment, unlike other cross-platform systems. 

2. Simple configuration files placed in each source directory (called CMakeLists.txt files) are used to generate standard build files which are used in the usual way. 

3. CMake can generate a native build environment that will compile source code, create libraries, generate wrappers and build executables in arbitrary combinations. 

4. CMake supports in-place and out-of-place builds, and can therefore support multiple builds from a single source tree.
