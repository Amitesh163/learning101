3. Difference between sh and bash

 sh (Bourne shell) is a shell command-line interpreter, for Unix/Unix-like operating systems. It provides some built-in commands. In scripting language we denote interpreter as #!/bin/sh. It was one most widely supported by other shells like bash (free/open), kash (not free).
 
 Bash (Bourne again shell) is a shell replacement for the Bourne shell. Bash is superset of sh. Bash supports sh. POSIX is a set of standards defining how POSIX-compliant systems should work. Bash is not actually a POSIX compliant shell. In a scripting language we denote the interpreter as #!/bin/bash.

4. What is GNOME?

 GNOME is an easy to use GUI (graphical user interface) and a set of computer desktop applications for Unix-based operating systems.
 GNOME was originally short for GNU Network Object Model Environment. However, today is no longer considered an acronym.

5. What is Shell?

 In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.
