1. What is an image?
   An image is nothing more than a two dimensional signal. It is defined by the mathematical function f(x,y) where x and y are the two co-ordinates horizontally and vertically. The value of f(x,y) at any point is gives the pixel value at that point of an image.
   In other words, an image can be defined by a two-dimensional array specifically arranged in rows and columns.

2. What is brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of an image?
   A. Brightness is a term used to describe the overall amount of light in an image.
   B. Contrast is a term used to denote the degree of difference between the brightest and 
darkest components in an image.
   C. Hue is the main indication of color. It is the value actually telling you which color it is or the value that lets you go "red" when you see a red object.
   D. Saturation is the perceived intensity. In other words it is a value of how dominant the color is, or how colorful the object looks.

3. What is the difference between image processing and computer vision?
   Computer Vision:
In Computer Vision, computers or machines are made to gain high-level understanding from the input digital images or videos with the purpose of automating tasks that the human visual system can do. It uses many techniques and Image Processing is just one of them.
   Image Processing:
Image Processing is the field of enhancing the images by tuning many parameter and features of the images. So Image Processing is the subset of Computer Vision. Here, transformations are applied to an input image and an the resultant output image is returned. Some of these transformations are- sharpening, smoothing, stretching etc.
